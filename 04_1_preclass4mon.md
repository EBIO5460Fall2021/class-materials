### Week 4: Preclass preparation for Mon

Make sure you're caught up on any previous work and you've pushed all your work to GitHub!

1. **Feedback for me**. Let me know how the class is going for you so far. I want to check in about homework and how the flipped format is working. Please fill out the qualtrics survey here:
   * https://cuboulder.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_7PpMBhBUUPiWhwy 1-3 mins
2. **Skill 1 of the week, Git:** branch, merge, amend, .gitignore, GUI
   * [git04_branching.md](skills_tutorials/git04_branching.md) - branching and merging
   * [git05_amend.md](skills_tutorials/git05_amend.md) - make minor updates without messing up your history
   * [git06_gitignore.md](skills_tutorials/git06_gitignore.md) - how to not track all files
   * [git07_gitgui.md](skills_tutorials/git07_gitgui.md) - how to invoke the GUI
3. **Skill 2 of the week: coding style**
   * Read the class style guide: [ebio5460_r_style_guide.md](skills_tutorials/ebio5460_r_style_guide.md)
   * Modify your code so far to conform with the style guide. **Push your changes to GitHub.**
4. **Reading on the bootstrap algorithm**
   * [04_2_bootstrap_algo.md](04_2_bootstrap_algo.md)
5. **Apply bootstrap to your linear dataset**
   * Use the **empirical** bootstrap algorithm to calculate 95% confidence intervals for the parameters and confidence bands for y. Use the percentile method to do this. Note that this is not simply running your data through my code: you will need to combine aspects of the code that I introduced in different places. **Push your code to GitHub.**
