### Week 2: Preclass homework for Monday
For the duration of the semester, you should complete these homework assignments before class. In class, we will generally build on the pre-class work or you will share your work with a small group.

1. Please be sure to finish the pre-test survey by **Friday**. I'll summarize the results for Monday.

2. **Skill of the week:** version control using Git. Once you have received an email from me (sometime Thursday), take control of your repo (see [git02_your_repo.md](skills_tutorials/git02_your_repo.md)). In [git03_basics.md](skills_tutorials/git03_basics.md) learn the basics of how Git works, how to make a repository, add files to it, track changes, and backtrack to a previous state.

3. Watch the video lecture on "What is an algorithm?"
   * [02_2_slides_what_is_an_algorithm.pdf](02_2_slides_what_is_an_algorithm.pdf)
   * [02_2_video_what_is_an_algorithm.md]()
   * Video is not quite ready - should be ready Thu afternoon, check back later
   
4. Use the R function `lm()` to analyze a dataset that has a linearish relationship between y and x. This should be a simple linear regression - no multiple regression models - just y and one continuous variable x. This should preferably be an analysis you've done before, either as part of your research, or in a previous stats class. It should be a complete analysis from question to conclusion. I want you to reflect on this seemingly simple task. Your R script should be well commented, including what question you were asking (i.e. what was the goal of your analysis?) and how the analysis answers that question. You might highlight areas that you're not sure about, output that you don't fully understand etc. This is a low stakes reflection - I'm not asking you to get it right or do it perfectly but to set a starting point for your learning journey this semester.  **Push your R script to your GitHub repository**. To push, you first commit to your local repository, then do

   ```bash
   git push
   ```

5. Consider your *workflow* as an algorithm. Make a flow diagram or sketch of your data analysis workflow for the simple linear regression you just did (e.g. like the "get to work algorithm").  What steps did you go through to get from question to conclusion? We will discuss these together on Monday and begin to outline a best-practice workflow for data science. A photo of a hand drawn sketch is fine. **Push your diagram (e.g. as a .jpg or .pdf) to your GitHub repository**.

6. Watch the video lecture on "The 3 classes of algorithms for data science"
   * [02_3_slides_3classes_algorithms4ds.pdf](02_3_slides_3classes_algorithms4ds.pdf)
   * [02_3_video_3classes_algorithms4ds.md](02_3_video_3classes_algorithms4ds.md) (11 mins)
