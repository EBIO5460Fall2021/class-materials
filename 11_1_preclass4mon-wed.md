### Week 11: Preclass preparation for Mon-Wed

Multilevel models, individual proposals, R markdown.

#### 1. Read and investigate code for multilevel models Parts II & III of the radon example

* [11_2_radon_multilevel_2.md](11_2_radon_multilevel_2.md): part II includes a house-scale predictor
* [11_3_radon_multilevel_3.md](11_3_radon_multilevel_3.md) part III adds a county-scale predictor and demonstrates the Bayesian analysis with `stan_lmer()`.
* Cross reference Chapter 12 of Gelman & Hill.

#### 2. Individual project proposal

Read the guidelines for the individual project:

* [00_individual_project.md](00_individual_project.md)

Review these guidelines now and please ask me for any clarifications etc. I probably haven't thought of everything you might need to know. Also, we haven't covered everything mentioned here yet but we will.

Next, expand and finalize your proposal. I will first review your bullet points from last week. Wait until I get back to you about that. Then, you should expand your bullet points with a bit more detail  to turn in a brief final project proposal (about half a page).

Save as a markdown or text file to your repo and **push to GitHub**.

#### 3. Skill of the week: R markdown

* [repsci04_rmarkdown.md](skills_tutorials/repsci04_rmarkdown.md)

#### 4. Begin EDA for individual project

Use Rmarkdown (`.Rmd` file format), `dplyr` for data manipulation and `ggplot` for plotting. Think about how best to display the multilevel structure of your data. Aim to show the data clearly. Show all the data. Use comments/text to explain how the data are structured. Work hard to spot any potential problems using plots, and code queries such as `unique()`, `range()`, `class()`. Consider appropriate distributions.

**Push your EDA to GitHub** in both `.Rmd` and GitHub markdown (`.md`) format.  The exception to this is if you have been using `.Rmd` exclusively up to now. Switch to try `.R` with Rmarkdown formatting instead.
