# Git Gui
There's not much to say here, except that you might consider whether you prefer a graphical user interface (GUI) instead of the command line for routine tasks. I use the official Git GUI, which is installed when you install Git. I use the GUI for basic stage, diff, commit, push since I find it faster than the command line for that. In fact, I also use it for most other basic tasks like fetch, merge, branch. In a windows environment you can simply right-click within the repository directory and choose "Git GUI here". The other thing I use it for is visualizing the history (including branches).

To invoke the GUI from the command line:

```bash
git gui
```

To invoke the history viewer:

```bash
gitk
```

Apart from the official GUI, there are many 3rd party GUIs.
