# Git branching and merging
Using branches to experiment with new ideas is a powerful feature of Git that is useful anytime. Branching is also an important technique for collaborative coding. The basic pattern is:

* make a new branch and switch to it
* make experimental changes in the new branch until satisfied
* merge changes back into the main branch (usually master)

A summary of the git commands covered:\
`git branch` List all a Git project's branches.\
`git branch branch_name` Create a new branch.\
`git checkout branch_name` Switch from one branch to another.\
`git merge branch_name` Merge a branch into the current branch.\
`git branch -d branch_name` Delete a branch.
