# Images in a markdown document
To insert a graphic in a markdown document:

```
![alt text here](path-to-image-here)
```

Take care with the path: the image path needs to **start** in the same directory as your `.R` or `.Rmd` file. I suggest putting the image file in a directory called `images` or in the same directory as the graphics output from the analysis.
